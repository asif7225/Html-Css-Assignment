<h1><b>M</b>achine Learning:</h1>
<p>Classification, regression,<b>Deep</b>learning,pycharm, <b><em>jupyter,Aws</em></b>Now that you know the basics of machine learning, let's dive a little bit deeper. At the end of this chapter, you will know the different types of machine learning, as well as how to evaluate and improve your models.we'll define machine learning and its relation to data science and artificial intelligence. Then, we'll unpack important machine learning jargon and end with the machine learning workflow for building models.</p>
<h1>What you will learn:</h1>
<p>Analyze big data and make <b>data-driven</b> predictions through probabilistic modeling and statistical inference; identify and deploy appropriate modeling and <b><i>methodologies in order to extract</i></b> meaningful information for decision making.Develop and build machine learning algorithms to extract meaningful information from seemingly unstructured data; learn popular unsupervised learning methods, including clustering methodologies and supervised methods such as deep neural networks </p>

<h1>Program Overview:</h1>
<p>Data scientists bring value to <b>organizations</b> across industries because they are able to solve complex <b><i>challenges with data and drive</i></b> important decision-making processes. Not only is there a huge demand, but there is a significant shortage of qualified data scientists with 39% of the most rigorous data science positions requiring a degree higher than a bachelorâ€™s.

This MicroMasters program in Statistics and Data Science is comprised of four online courses and a virtually proctored exam that will provide you with the foundational knowledge essential to understanding the methods and tools used</p>
<h1> <a name="sajjad"> Artifical Intelligence:</a>
</h1>

<p> (AI), is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.[3] Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines (or computers) that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving".</p>
