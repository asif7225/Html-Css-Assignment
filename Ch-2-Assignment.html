<h2>Machine learning</h2>
<p>
In Victorian England, <b>Lady Ada Lovelace was a friend and collaborator of Charles Babbage</b>, the inventor of the Analytical Engine: the first-known general-purpose, mechanical computer. Although visionary and far ahead of its time, the Analytical Engine wasn’t meant as a general-purpose computer when it was designed in the <strong>1830s and 1840s, because the concept of general-purpose computation was yet to be invented</strong>. It was merely meant as a way to use mechanical operations to automate certain computations from the field of mathematical analysis—hence, the name Analytical Engine. In 1843, Ada Lovelace remarked on the invention,

<h2>Learning representations from data</h2>
<p>To define deep <i>learning and understand the difference between deep learning</i> and other machine-learning approaches, first we need some idea of what machinelearning algorithms do. I just stated that machine learning <em>discovers rules to execute a data-processing task</em>, given examples of what’s expected. So, to do machine learning, we need three things:</p>

<h2>The “deep” in deep learning</h2>
<p>Deep learning is a specific subfield of <abbr title="machine learning">ML</abbr>: a new take on learning representations from data that puts an emphasis on learning successive layers of increasingly meaningful representations. The deep in <abbr title="deep learning">DP</abbr> isn’t a reference to any kind of deeper <abbr title="machine learning">understanding achieved by the approach; rather, it stands for this idea of</abbr> successive layers of representations. How many layers contribute to a model of the data is called the depth of the model. Other appropriate names for the field could have been layered representations learning and hierarchical representations learning. Modern <abbr title="deep learning">DP</abbr> often involves tens or even hundreds of successive layers of representations— and they’re all learned automatically from exposure to training data. Meanwhile, other approaches to machine learning tend to focus on learning only one or two layers of representations of the data; hence, they’re sometimes called shallow learning</p>

<h2>Understanding how deep learning works</h2>
<p>
At this point, you know <cite>that machine learning is about mapping inputs (such as images) to targets</cite> (such as the label “cat”), which is done by observing many examples of input and targets. You also know that deep neural networks do this input-to-target

<h2>Don’t believe the short-term hype</h2>
<p>
Although deep learning has led to <s>remarkable achievements in recent years, expectations for what the field will be able to achieve in the next decade tend to run much higher than what will likely be possible</s>. Although some world-changing applications like autonomous cars are already within reach, many more are likely to remain elusive for a long time, such as believable dialogue systems, human-level machine translation across arbitrary languages, and human-level natural-language understanding.

<h2>The promise of AI</h2>
<p>
Although we may have unrealistic short-term expectations for <sup>AI</sup>, the long-term picture is looking bright. We’re only getting started in applying <sup>deep learning</sup> to many important problems for <sup>which it could</sup> prove transformative, from medical diagnoses to digital assistants. <sub>AI</sub> research has been moving forward amazingly quickly in the past <sub>five years</sub>, in large part due to a level of funding never before seen in the short history of AI, <sub>but so far relatively little of this progress has made its</sub> way into the products and processes that form our world.

Right now, it may seem hard to believe that AI could have a large impact on our world, because it isn’t yet widely deployed—much as, back in 1995, it would have been difficult to believe in the future impact of the internet. Back then, most people didn’t see how the internet was relevant to them and how it was going to change their lives. The same is true for deep learning and AI today. But make no mistake: AI is coming. In a notso-distant future, AI will be your assistant, even your friend; it will answer your questions, help educate your kids, and watch over your health. It will deliver your groceries to your door and drive you from point A to point B. It will be your interface to an increasingly complex and information-intensive world. And, even more important, AI will help
humanity as a whole move forward, by assisting human scientists in new breakthrough discoveries across all scientific fields, from genomics to mathematics.
